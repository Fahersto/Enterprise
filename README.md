# Enterprise Engine
Enterprise is a "pet project" game engine I'm developing in my free time. It is written in C++17 
for Mac and Windows computers.

To get the engine, use Git to clone this repository using `--recurse-submodules`. If you're 
cloning with HTTPS, your script should look similar to the following:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/theOtherMichael/Enterprise.git

## Prerequisites
To build Enterprise, the following must be installed on your system:
* OS: At least **Windows 10** or **macOS 10.15**
* (Windows developers) **The Windows 10 SDK**: download it [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) 
or as an optional component of the [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* (Mac developers) **Command Line Tools for Xcode**: Download it [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode) 
(requires a free Apple developer account) or install [Xcode itself](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
* **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.22 or later**

## Build Instructions

Enterprise uses CMake to generate its build system. If you are already familiar with CMake, you 
should be able to build Enterprise using your favorite tools, as long as:

* Your CMake version is at least **3.22**.
* Your compiler is either **MSVC** or **Clang**.
* You target **64-bit architectures**.

*Note: I have only personally tested building Enterprise with the Ninja, Unix Makefile, Visual 
Studio, and Xcode generators.*

If you are unfamiliar with CMake but still wish to build Enterprise, I recommend installing 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the 
[C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack). 
Then, follow these steps to build:

1. Open the Enterprise root directory in VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette (*Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P*) and select `CMake: Configure`
3. In the Run panel (*Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D*) select a "Windows" or "lldb" (macOS) debugging preset, 
depending on your platform
4. Press *F7* to build the engine, or *F5* to debug it

More information about building Enterprise will be available in the Enterprise documentation, which 
can be generated by following the steps below.

## Documentation Generation
If you have [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) installed on your computer, you can use 
it to generate HTML documentation for the engine. To do this, simply run *gendocs_win.bat* or 
*gendocs_mac.command* from the Enterprise root directory. The documentation will show up in 
*docs*. Note that the script currently requires Doxygen to be installed in `Program Files/doxygen` 
(Windows) or `/Applications` (Mac).

If you are a Mac user, you won't be allowed to run the script out of the box. You can add 
execution permission to the script using `chmod u+x gendocx_mac.command` in Terminal, or you can 
simply run the script from Terminal by using `sh gendocx_mac.command`.

## Current State of Development
* The `Time` system (done\*)
* The `Events` system (done\*)
* The `File` system (done\*)
* The `Input` system (done\*)
* The `Graphics` system (done\*)
* The `SceneManager` system (done\*)
* The `StateManager` system (done\*)
* Enterprise editor (**up next**)
* Script components
* The `Audio` system

\* = good enough to move on from.

At this point, all of Enterprise's core systems, except for Audio, have MVP's. The next big goal 
is to put together the Enterprise editor, which will allow the creation of much more robust systems 
and content.
