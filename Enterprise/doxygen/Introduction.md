@mainpage Intro to %Enterprise

%Enterprise is a game engine for Windows and macOS.  It is being developed under the following precepts:

* **Help the programmers.**  Programming is the fundamental game development tool.  Instead of focusing on robust editors or pretty graphics, focus on an elegant, easy-to-understand code base and powerful, intuitive API's.
* **Prioritize flexibility.**  Empower developers to break conventions.  Avoid prescribing unnecessary application structures through the engine design.
* **Keep it simple.**  There's value in a lightweight framework.  Avoid developing features which will not be used in every game.  Make optional features truly optional.
* **Support modular design.**  Make it easy to transplant custom code and assets between game projects.

All the resources in this documentation are available in the side panel on the left. To get orientated with %Enterprise, I recommend starting with the following pages:

%Enterprise is created by Michael Martz.  Both %Enterprise and this documentation are works in progress.
